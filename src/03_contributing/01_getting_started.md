# Getting Starting

If you'd like to support or get involved with Silicon Melbourne, that project is a great place to start. There is usually always a mix of technical or non-technical items there that are tagged with "help wanted". Keep in mind that not everything will be represented there. If you see an opportunity, call it out.

Anyone picking up tasks from the project will need to have their own [GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/creating-an-account-on-github) and be assigned to the organisation. Ping `@moderator` in the [#contributing](https://discord.com/channels/1377448057179865169/1390166473799893123) channel in the community Discord to see how you can help.

## Attribution

If you do provide help and support to Silicon Melbourne, please ask a moderator to add you to list of contributors. This won't happen by default as not everyone wants public recognition.
