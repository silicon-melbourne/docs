# Who we are

Silicon Melbourne was founded by me, [Tom](https://tomlingham.com/). It is a labour of love that I dedicate as much time as I can to, but probably much less than it needsâ€”please be patient.

I'm looking for help leading and executing on a broader community vision. DM me on the Discord or Email me ([tom@silicon.melbourne](mailto:tom@silicon.melbourne)) if you'd like to get involved or think you might be able to help.

If you'd like to help out more with the day-to-day, take a look at the [Contributing Guide](../03_contributing/01_chapter.md) for ways you can support Silicon Melbourne with your time, or feel free to reach out to me on the [Silicon Melbourne Discord](https://silicon.melbourne/) if you're not sure but would like to participate somehow.

Our community is only made possible with the help of our [Volunteers](./04_volunteers.md).
