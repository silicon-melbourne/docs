# Who we are

At this time Silicon Melbourne is just [Tom Lingham](https://tomlingham.com/).

Currently this is a labour of love that I dedicate as much time as I can to (probably less than it needs) therefore I am always looking for others to help and pitch in.

If you'd like to help out, take a look at the [contributing guide](./contributing/01-getting-started.md) for ways you can support Silicon Melbourne with your time, or feel free to reach out to me on the [Silicon Melbourne Discord](https://silicon.melbourne/) if you're not sure but would like to do something. Creatively, my handle is: `@tomlingham`.
