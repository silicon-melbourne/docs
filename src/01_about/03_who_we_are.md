# Who we are

At this time Silicon Melbourne is officially just me, [Tom Lingham](https://tomlingham.com/).

I'm looking for help leading and executing on a broader community vision. Email me ([tom@silicon.melbourne](mailto:tom@silicon.melbourne)) if you'd like to get involved or think you might be able to help.

Currently Silicon Melbourne is a labour of love that I dedicate as much time as I can to, but probably less than it needsâ€”please be patient.

If you'd like to help out, take a look at the [Contributing Guide](./contributing/01-getting-started.md) for ways you can support Silicon Melbourne with your time, or feel free to reach out to me on the [Silicon Melbourne Discord](https://silicon.melbourne/) if you're not sure but would like to do something. Creatively, my handle is: `@tomlingham`.
