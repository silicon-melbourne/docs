# Who we are

At this time Silicon Melbourne is officially just [Tom Lingham](https://tomlingham.com/), but I'm looking for additional members to assist with leading and executing on a broader community vision.

Others that have helped in some capacity with Silicon Melbourne are recognised on our [Supporters](./04_supporters.md) page.

Currently this is a labour of love that I dedicate as much time as I can to (probably less than it needs) therefore I am always looking for others to help and pitch in.

If you'd like to help out, take a look at the [contributing guide](./contributing/01-getting-started.md) for ways you can support Silicon Melbourne with your time, or feel free to reach out to me on the [Silicon Melbourne Discord](https://silicon.melbourne/) if you're not sure but would like to do something. Creatively, my handle is: `@tomlingham`.
