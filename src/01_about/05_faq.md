## Why should I join Silicon Melbourne?

Silicon Melbourne is community of people in Technology in Melbourne and surrounding areas. It's a refreshing alternative to platforms like LinkedIn that have largely monopolised casual community interactions (especially for those in the professional Melbourne Technology scene). We don't expect Silicon Melbourne to replace LinkedIn but we do expect it to be a more human and connected alternative that gives back to the community.

We think there are a lot of reasons why Silicon Melbourne is a great place to be.

If  you're:
- in the midst of a flourishing career and would like to offer some words of wisdom
- trying to enter technology for the first time and struggling to find out how to navigate and connect with others
- looking for work for too long and feel like you're alone on this journey
- interested in connecting with people in tech outside your sphere or simply have a seat in a room with your peers
- weary of the hyperbole, self-promotion, click/rage bait, and commercialised content engulfing social media, but still want to be part of something bigger

We think Silicon Melbourne has something to offer you. Come and [join the Discord](https://silicon.melbourne/).

## How do I get started?

Join our [Discord server](https://silicon.melbourne/) and introduce yourself! We have channels for different technology domains, career discussions, and general community chat.

## Can I contribute to the community?
 
Absolutely! We're always looking for volunteers to help with moderation, community advocacy, and organising events. Check out our [Volunteering](../03_contributing/03_volunteering.md) page to see current opportunities.

## Is there a cost to join?

No, Silicon Melbourne is completely free to join and participate in. We're supported by our community volunteers.

## Can I sponsor, donate, or give Silicon Melbourne money somehow?

Not yet, but hopefully soon. Any expenses are simply covered out-of-pocket for the time being.

## What if I'm new to the tech industry?

Everyone is welcome! We have many community members who are just starting their careers, changing careers, or exploring different areas of technology. Our community is designed to support people at all stages of their professional journey.

## Can I be anonymous?

Yes, we strongly welcome anonymous participation in respect of the internet of old and in respect of differences in individual circumstances and personal safety. However, we *recommend* that people use their real names and link to their other real social profiles, as Silicon Melbourne is a place of professional networking and you may not see the real-world impact of participating with your real identity.

Anonymous users should be aware that:
- You may have restrictions when it comes to receiving elevated privileges (like moderator roles)
- You may be more liberally kicked or banned for breaking the rules
- We may introduce additional restrictions for anonymous users in the future if we find it difficult to appropriately moderate them (though we will try not to)

If you choose to participate anonymously, please be mindful that moderation decisions may be made more quickly and with less consideration than for identified members.

## Why Discord?

Very few community platforms can support large communities at little to no cost. Self-hosting alternatives would create significant barriers to entry that many potential members would struggle to overcome. Discord offers:

- A number of tech professionals already have Discord accounts or can easily create one
- Free for communities of our size with all necessary features
- Role management and other mature moderation tools (including a robust and comprehensive API)
- Works well on both mobile and desktop

While Discord has its limitations, it allows us to focus our energy on building community rather than managing technical infrastructure. We'll continue to leave the door open to whether Discord serves the communities needs as we continue to grow.
