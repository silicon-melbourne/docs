# Mission

Our mission is to build a vibrant, connected, and resilient Melbourne Technology community.

We'll do that by enabling low-friction connection free of corporate interests, and give back to the community in a manner that supports those in it.

## Principles

The following are the principles by which we operate Silicon Melbourne.

### Community First

Silicon Melbourne is built by and for its members. We favour transparency, community-mindedness, and are guided by what genuinely benefits our members. See our [contributing guide](./contributing/01-getting-started.md) to see how you can get involved, influence, and support the community.

### Meaningful Connection

We value every member, regardless of how actively they participate. Our goal isn't banal engagement metrics and we instead aim to create a space that is valuable to both those actively engaging or those simply observing.

### Transparency

All financial contributions, including donations and sponsorships will be documented and made available publicly. Sponsorships are accepted strictly with no strings attached and funds directly support community operations and initiatives.

### Authentic Engagement

We prioritise real interactions and conversations. Silicon Melbourne is a moderated space free from commercial agendas and unsolicited promotions, ensuring discussions remain genuine, personal, and helpful. We believe moderation is important to fostering that engagement, upholding principles, elevating the conversation, and creating a welcoming space.

### Inclusivity

We welcome all people that align with the Technology industry in Melbourne and Victoria.
