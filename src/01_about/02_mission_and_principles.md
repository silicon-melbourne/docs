# Mission

Our mission is to build a vibrant, connected, and resilient Melbourne technology community free from corporate interests that serves it's community members.

The following are the principles by which we operate Silicon Melbourne:

**Community owned:**
Silicon Melbourne is built by and for it's community members. We favour transparency, community-mindedness, and are guided by what genuinely benefits our members. See our [contributing guide](../04_contributing/01_getting_started.md) to see how you can get involved to influence, build, and support the community.

**Authentic:**
We value every member, regardless of how actively they participate. Rather than chasing engagement metrics, we aim to create a space that is valuable to both those actively engaging and those simply observing.

**Transparent:**
All operational matters and financial contributions (including donations and sponsorships) will be documented and made available publicly. Sponsorships (when we are able to take them) will be accepted with strictly no-strings-attached terms and funds directly supporting community operations and initiatives.

**Moderated:**
We prioritise genuine interaction and conversation. Active moderation is critical to upholding community principles, elevating the conversation, and creating a welcoming space for everyone in technology. We strive to make moderation transparent where possible and practical.

**Inclusive:**
We welcome all people aligned with the technology industry in Melbourne and Victoria, Australia. We are moderated and rule breaking will result in bans, however we err on the side of issuing warnings and aim to coach individuals on how to engage in the community rather than have them leave entirely (within reason).
