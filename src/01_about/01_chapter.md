# About

Silicon Melbourne is a free and open online community by and for everyone in the technology industry in Melbourne and Victoria.

Born from frustration at being unable to connect freely with others in the Melbourne technology sphere, Silicon Melbourne is a response to the creeping normalcy of community erosion by platforms like LinkedIn. Social media has long redefined the term "community" and the role it plays in shaping our world. While online interaction has cemented itself in our culture, platforms (like LinkedIn) position "connection" as nothing more than binary transactionsâ€”a poor substitute for the real thing.

Post the [pandemic lockdowns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Victoria) we saw a significant and rapid shift in industry culture and, anecdotally, many believe that the once vibrant Melbourne technology community has since struggled to recover. Combined with recent economic uncertainty and many industry leaders' surprising backflip on the importance of people in tech, many feel disheartened, disconnected, and abandoned.

Silicon Melbourne hopes to solve this by being a forward-looking reimagining of what the technology community in Melbourne (and Victoria) can be.
