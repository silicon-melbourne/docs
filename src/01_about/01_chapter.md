Borne out of frustration of not being able to connect freely with others in the Melbourne Technology sphere, Silicon Melbourne is a response to the creeping normalcy of community erosion by platforms like LinkedIn. Social Media platforms have, for the longest time, continued to redefine the term "community" and the role it plays in shaping our world. While the concept of online "community" has cemented itself in our culture, platforms (like LinkedIn) frame "connection" as binary transactionsâ€”a poor proxy for human connection.

Post [pandemic lockdowns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Victoria) we saw a significant and rapid shift in industry culture and, anecdotally, many believe that the once vibrant Melbourne Technology community has struggled to recover. Add to that a period of economic and industry uncertainty, a surprising 180 from some industry leaders on the importance of people in tech, and you leave many feeling disheartened, disconnected, and hung-out-to-dry.

Silicon Melbourne, hoping to solve this, is a forward-looking reimagining of what the Technology Community in Melbourne (and Victoria) can be.
