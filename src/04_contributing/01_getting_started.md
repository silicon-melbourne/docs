# Getting Starting

If you'd like to support or get involved with Silicon Melbourne, that project is a great place to start. There is usually always a mix of technical or non-technical items there that are tagged with `help wanted`. Keep in mind that not everything will be represented there. If you see an opportunity and would like to do something with it, call it out.

Anyone picking up tasks from the project will need to have their own [GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/creating-an-account-on-github) and be assigned to the [organisation](https://github.com/silicon-melbourne). Ping `@moderator` in the [#ops](https://discord.com/channels/1377448057179865169/1390166473799893123) channel in the community Discord to get the ball rolling.

## Attribution

If you do provide help and support to Silicon Melbourne and would like attribution please ask a moderator to add you to the list of supporters. This won't happen by default as not everyone wants public recognition.
