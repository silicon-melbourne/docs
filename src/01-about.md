# About

Borne out of a frustration of being unable to connect freely with others in the Melbourne Technology sphere, Silicon Melbourne is a response to the creeping normalcy of community erosion by platforms like LinkedIn. Social Media platforms have, for the longest time, continued to redefine the term "community" and the role it plays in colouring our lives. While online "community" has cemented itself in our culture, platforms like LinkedIn frame connection as binary transactionsâ€”a poor proxy for human connection.

Post-[pandemic lockdowns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Victoria) saw a significant and rapid shift in industry culture and, anecdotally, the once vibrant Melbourne Technology community has struggled to recover. Add to that a period of economic and industry uncertainty, an apparent 180 from some industry leaders on the importance of people in tech and you leave many feeling disheartened, disconnected, and hung-out-to-dry.

Silicon Melbourne, hoping to solve this, is a forward-looking reimagining of what the Technology Community in Melbourne (and Victoria) can be.

# Who we are

At this time Silicon Melbourne is just me, [Tom](https://tomlingham.com/). This is a labour of love that I dedicate as much time as I can to (probably less than it needs) but I am always looking for help. See the [contributing guide](./contributing/01-getting-started.md) for ways you can support Silicon Melbourne or feel free to reach out to me on the [Silicon Melbourne Discord](https://silicon.melbourne/). My handle is creatively `@tomlingham`. Otherwise you can ping our moderator team `@moderator` and someone will help you.

# Mission

Our mission is to build a vibrant, connected, and resilient Melbourne Technology community.

We'll do that by enabling low-friction, and low-cost connection free of corporate interests, and give back to the community in a manner that supports those in it.

# Principles

The following are the principles by which we operate Silicon Melbourne.

## Community First

Silicon Melbourne is built by and for its members. We favour transparency, community-mindedness, and are guided by what genuinely benefits our members. See our [contributing guide](./contributing/01-getting-started.md) to see how you can get involved, influence, and support the community.

## Meaningful Connection

We value every member, regardless of how actively they participate. Our goal isn't banal engagement metrics and we instead aim to create a space that is valuable to both those actively engaging or those simply observing.

## Transparency

All financial contributions, including donations and sponsorships will be documented and made available publicly. Sponsorships are accepted strictly with no strings attached and funds directly support community operations and initiatives.

## Authentic Engagement

We prioritise real interactions and conversations. Silicon Melbourne is a moderated space free from commercial agendas and unsolicited promotions, ensuring discussions remain genuine, personal, and helpful. We believe moderation is important to fostering that engagement, upholding principles, elevating the conversation, and creating a welcoming space.

## Inclusivity

We welcome all people that align with the Technology industry in Melbourne and Victoria.
