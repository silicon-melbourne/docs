# About

Borne out of a frustration of being unable to connect freely with others in the Technology sphere, Silicon Melbourne is a response to the creeping normalcy of community erosion by Social Media giants, a la. LinkedIn. Post-[pandemic lockdowns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Victoria) saw a significant and rapid shift in industry culture and, anecdotally, many have felt that since then the once vibrant Melbourne Technology community has lost some of it's *shine*. Add to that a recent period of economic and industry uncertainty, an apparent 180 from some industry leaders on the importance of people in tech, and you are left with many feeling disconnected and hung-out-to-dry.

Silicon Melbourne a forward-looking attempt at reimagining what the Technology Community in Melbourne, and Victoria, can be.

# Who we are

At this time Silicon Melbourne is just me, [Tom](https://tomlingham.com/). It is a labour of love that I dedicate as much time as I can to (probably less than it needs) but I am always looking for help. See the [contributing guide](./contributing/01-getting-started.md) for ways you can support Silicon Melbourne or feel free to reach out to me on the [Silicon Melbourne Discord](https://silicon.melbourne/). My handle is very creative: `@tomlingham`.

# Mission

Our mission is to unite Melbourne Technology and facilitate meaningful, low-friction, and low-cost connection, and ultimately working towards a more connected, vibrant, and resilient community.

Whether you're actively engaging or simply sitting quietly and observingâ€”this is a space for all working in the broader Melbourne Technology community.

# Principles

The following are the principles by which we operate Silicon Melbourne:

## Community First

Silicon Melbourne is built by and for its members. We favour transparency, community-mindedness, and are guided by what genuinely benefits our members. See our [contributing guide](./contributing/01-getting-started.md) to see how you can get involved, influence, and support the community.

## Meaningful Connection

We value every member, regardless of how actively they participate. Our goal isn't banal engagement metrics and we instead aim to create a space that is valuable to both those actively engaging or simply observing.

## Transparency

All financial contributions, including donations and sponsorships will be documented and made available publicly. Sponsorships are accepted strictly with no strings attached and funds directly support community operations and initiatives.

## Authentic Engagement

We prioritise real interactions and conversations. Silicon Melbourne is a moderated space free from commercial agendas and unsolicited promotions, ensuring discussions remain genuine, personal, and helpful. We believe moderation is important to fostering that engagement, upholding principles, and elevating the conversation.

## Inclusivity

We welcome those from all backgrounds that operate within the Technology industry in Melbourne. Everyone, regardless of background or experience, is valued simply for being present and part of the community.
